#Template Classes and Doubly Linked Lists
This project uses template classes and doubly linked lists to make a copy of a list using the copy constructor, output the original list frontwards, output the copy frontwards, output the original list backwards, destroy the original list by alternating between removal of the first item and the last item, outputting each item as it is removed, and output the copy backwards. I created:
  node_iterator.template
  node_iterator.h
  dnode.h
  dlist.template
  dlist.h
